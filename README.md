## Description of portfolio website:
- **Purpose**

The intended purpose of the portfolio website is to act as a platform for future employers or clients to grasp a basic understanding of who they potentially will be working for. The website identifies a style of work, skills available and some basic personal information and interests. There is contacts page which will also allow for visitors of the webpage to fill out a form to contact.

- **Functionality/features**

The website features a typographic home page outlining basic information including name and qualifications. Second is a 'About Me' page which outlines some basic personal information including some personal projects undertaken in recent periods. As more projects are undertaken this page will be a solid platform to showcase past work to prospective clients. There is a 'Blog' page which has been created using place holder images and text but the layout can be used as an interesting place to keep people up to date on personal experiences and work that is undertaken an a more informal space. These blogs could include other peoples work that i am finding interesting at the time or some ongoing updates about projects that are in progress. Finally a contact page in which people are able to directly send messages as an email to myself. Each page is contained with a footer which includes icons with links to personal linkedin, github and resume.
